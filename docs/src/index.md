# Latte.jl

Latte is a high-performance DSL for deep neural networks.  Our goal was to
design a language that closely matched domain concepts without sacrificing
performance.  We are working hard on filling out this site with documentation,
tutorials, and examples.

!!! note
    Latte is prelease (alpha) software, please report bugs using the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/IntelLabs/Latte.jl/issues). For usage questions, visit the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/IntelLabs/Latte.jl).
