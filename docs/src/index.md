# Latte.jl

Latte is a high-performance DSL for deep neural networks.  Our goal was to
design a language that closely matched domain concepts without sacrificing
performance.  

!!! note
    Please note that Latte is prelease (alpha) software and this site is a work
    in progress.  We are working hard on filling out this site with
    documentation, tutorials, and examples.  Please report bugs using the
    [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/IntelLabs/Latte.jl/issues). For
    usage questions, visit the 
    [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/IntelLabs/Latte.jl).
